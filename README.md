# Skins Preview Plugin

## **Description**

The **Skins Preview** plugin is a test implementation for previewing custom skins in AMX Mod X servers for Counter-Strike 1.6. It allows players to preview skins (weapons or player models) in-game by spawning a model in front of them, which follows their aim. The plugin includes a menu system to select skins, control their position, and toggle visibility settings.

-------

## **Features**

- Preview custom skins (weapons or player models) in-game.
- Menu to select from a predefined list of test skins.
- Control the preview distance (move closer or further away).
- Automatic rotation of the preview model.
- Configurable visibility: only the player can see the preview, or all players can see it.
- Timer to automatically remove the preview after a set duration.
- Colored chat messages with a custom prefix `[FWO]`.

-------

## **Usage**

1. **Open the Preview Menu**:
   - Type `/preview` in the chat while alive to open the skin preview menu.
   - Select a skin from the list to preview it.

2. **Control the Preview**:
   - A control menu will appear after selecting a skin:
     - **Move Closer**: Reduces the distance between you and the preview model (minimum: 20 units).
     - **Move Away**: Increases the distance (maximum: 70 units).
     - **Remove Preview**: Removes the preview and reopens the skin selection menu.
   - You can also press the "Exit" key (usually `0`) to remove the preview and reopen the skin selection menu.

3. **Timer**:
   - The preview will automatically disappear after a set duration (default: 15 seconds).
   - The remaining time is displayed in the center of your screen.

## **CVars**

The plugin includes several CVars for customization. You can set these in `amxmodx/configs/amxx.cfg` or use the `amx_cvar` command in-game.

| CVar                     | Default Value | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `preview_time`           | `15`          | Duration (in seconds) before the preview is automatically removed.          |
| `min_preview_distance`   | `20.0`        | Minimum distance (in units) between the player and the preview model.       |
| `max_preview_distance`   | `70.0`        | Maximum distance (in units) between the player and the preview model.       |
